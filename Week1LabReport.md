## Installing VS Code
If you already have VS Code installed, like I did, you can skip this step.

Go [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download VS Code and install it to your computer.
Make sure to click on the matching version for your operating system, and follow the steps carefully.
Once VS Code is installed, open it. It should look similar to this. <img width="1280" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110417473/212181995-dc6acdab-5f54-460e-a4b6-eaa973147a9e.png">

## Remotely Connecting
If you do not have Git installed, go [here](https://gitforwindows.org/), and follow the steps carefully. I already had Git installed, so I skipped this step, but it is not installed for Windows users by default.

Open VS Code. If you are using Windows, the terminal will default to Powershell. To change the default terminal to bash, you can go to the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P). <img width="1280" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110417473/212186764-5064ea67-0196-4bcc-ac92-11abb726e758.png">

In the Command Palette, run the Terminal: Select Default Profile command.

When prompted, select Git Bash to set your default terminal to Git Bash.

Open a new terminal using Ctrl/Command + Shift + `, or by selecting the option under the Terminal tab at the top of the screen. <img width="1280" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110417473/212188199-29490f5e-d4b7-4a65-b2f3-fccb6035c8e7.png"> 

Type in `ssh account_name@ieng6.ucsd.edu` and enter your password into the prompt.

If you entered everything correctly, you should see something similar. <img width="1280" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110417473/212501269-473a799f-97e4-4d9f-8c7c-980f312a8849.png">

## Trying Some Commands
Try using some of the following commands in the terminal:
- `pwd`, to print the path to the working directory
- `ls`, to list the contents of the working directory
- `cat`, to print the contents of a file given its path as a parameter
- `cd`, to change the working directory to a given path
